./NN Model1 _

If entering three arguments
first argument is model to open,second argument is training file,third argument is delimiter.

if entering two arguments, creating a new network. First argument is training file, second argument is delimiter.

Example1: ./NN Model1 M1T1 _

This restores neural network stored as Model1 and them uses M1T1 as training data. _ is delimiter for both files.

Example2: ./NN M1T1 _

This allows user to create a new neural network and then used training data, using delimiter given as final argument.

Neural Network always prompts user to save neural network as a model# using delimiter in the file.

run Neural network using model 1 neural network and M1T1 training data and _ as a delimiter for file parsing
